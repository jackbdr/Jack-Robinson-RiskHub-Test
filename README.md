# Submission

Hi Jordy, 

Thank you for sending this over!

Although I am pleased I got the main functionality going, I would have liked to have submitted a more complete Vue component. 

If I had more time I would:
- add proper form validation (currently only restricting input fields with "min" property) and display to the user with the exisiting 'errorMessage'
- improve styling for the order listing
- use function dispatch object and factory method to remove the need for chained if statements when creating a product
- handle if the product type is not recognised as one of the three options

I am also sure there are improvements that I have missed. The idea of working in a full stack role again excites me a lot and I would be eager to work on my frontend skills.

For the PHP task, I have added a simple `test.php` file which can be used to make sure the classes are working as expected.

Thanks again for sending over the test, I'm really keen on this opportunity and looking forward to potential next steps.

I hope you have a good weekend.

Best wishes,
Jack
